# Assign and monitor access as Administrator

As you work through this lab, you will select a different trusted profile that corresponds to each role within Hill Valley Bank. Let's start with the **Administrator** role.

## Identity and Access Management

Here you can create trusted profiles to automatically grant federated users access to your account based on external identity provider specifications

## Access Groups

Now let's investigate access groups by visiting [Access Groups](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/groups) in the **Left Navigation**

Here you create access groups to quickly and easily assign access to a set of users, service IDs and trusted profiles. To add identities and assign access to an existing group, click the group name.
