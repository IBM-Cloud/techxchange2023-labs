## Engineer

### Prerequisites:

Ensure the availability of an API key that the Trusted Profile (TP) can pick from the secrets manager during project creation. Also, confirm that the engineer has access to a pre-created resource group named after the username, e.g., "dalab-01".

### Catalog and Product Concepts

Understand the underlying principles of the catalog and the products within.

### Creating a New Product

Utilize the existing catalog and add a new product. For this, use the resources:

- [Simple DA Release](https://github.com/l2fprod/techxchange-simple-da/releases)
- [Product Archive](https://github.com/l2fprod/techxchange-simple-da/archive/refs/tags/v1.1.0.tar.gz)

Remember to rename the Product as "dalab-01". Validate the version by selecting the appropriate resource group and setting the username.
