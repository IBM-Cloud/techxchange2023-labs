# Getting started

Lets get ready! We are going to collaboratively set up a secure and compliant cloud for Hill Valley Bank.  First we are going to play the role of an Administrator where we will prepare the account for enterprise governance by establishing trust and assigning access to federated users. Second, we are going to transition to the Engineer role, where we will deploy are brand new OpenShift Environment following best practices for a banking Environment. Lastly, we will play the role of a Compliance Manager who will define and assess our continuous compliance posture of our bank.

**In this lab, you will:**
1. Review the access and permissions.
1. Identify and scan resources that need to be compliant with regulations.
1. Create a new Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) configuration and make it inside the enterprise.
1. Deploy this configuration.
1. Run a scan to assess the compliance of the deployed configuration.
