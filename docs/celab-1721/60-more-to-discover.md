# More to discover

There are more capabilities built in Code Engine to help you build and deploy your applications. Several are highlighted below.

## Custom domains

Domain mappings provide the URL route to your Code Engine applications within a project. With Code Engine, these mappings are automatically created, by default, whenever you deploy an application. However, you can map your own custom domain to a Code Engine application to route requests from your custom URL to your application.

If you want to target your application with a domain that you own, you can use a custom domain mapping. When you set a custom domain mapping in Code Engine, you define a 1-to-1 mapping between your fully qualified domain name (FQDN) and a Code Engine application in your project.

You can configure custom domains from the **Domain mappings** page for your specific application.

To learn more about using custom domains, see [Configuring custom domain mappings for your app](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-domain-mappings).

## Subscribe to events

Oftentimes in distributed environments you want your applications or jobs to react to messages (events) that are generated from other components, which are usually called event producers. With Code Engine, your applications or jobs can receive events of interest by subscribing to event producers. Event information is received as POST HTTP requests for applications and as environment variables for jobs.

Code Engine supports the following types of event producers:
* **Cron** - The cron event producer is based on cron and generates an event at regular intervals. Use a cron event producer when an action needs to be taken at well-defined intervals or at specific times.
* **IBM Cloud Object Storage** - The Object Storage event producer generates events as changes are made to the objects in your object storage buckets. For example, as objects are added to a bucket, an application can receive an event and then perform an action based on that change, perhaps consuming that new object.
* **Kafka** - The Kafka event producer watches for new messages to appear in a Kafka instance. When you create a Code Engine Kafka subscription for a set of topics, your app or job receives a separate event for each new message that appears in one of the topics.

To learn more about subscriptions, see [Getting started with subscriptions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-subscribing-events).
